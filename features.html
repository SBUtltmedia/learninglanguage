<h1 style="text-align: center;">Features</h1>
<i>Multilingual Flashcards<sup>10</sup></i> is a web application that introduces basic vocabulary words (about 170 content words) in ten languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish). It has the following features:
<ol>
	<li><b>Images:</b>  Each word is represented by a simple illustration.</li>
	<li><b>Authentic scripts:</b> By clicking any part of the card, learners can see how each word is written in the authentic script including non-Roman script.</li>
	<li><b>Authentic pronunciation: </b>By clicking the audio icon, users can hear a native speaker's pronunciations instead of synthesized sounds, which are commonly used in free digital flashcards.</li>
	<li><b>Immersion-type approach:</b> Users can directly associate the words that they hear with their meanings using images, without bypassing the English translation. (If needed, an English translation can be viewed at the bottom of each card.)</li>
	<li><b>Holistic approach: </b>Users can simultaneously learn not only the sound and meaning of each word, but also its written form. Script tables are provided for some languages.</li>
	<li><b>Chunk learning:</b> Each word is provided with a short sentence (or phrase) that includes it to promote "chunk" learning. Learners will know how the word is used in context and learn words in chunks. Studies have shown that chunk learning facilitates memorization and retention of vocabulary words.</li>
	<li><b>Inductive learning:</b> "Chunk" learning mentioned above also helps users naturally learn simple grammatical rules by paying attention to word forms and grammatical items that appear in these chunks. If needed, their translations can be viewed by clicking the "Sentence Translation" icon. Inductive learning encourages learners to notice grammatical patterns and develop their evidence-gathering and critical-thinking skills.</li>
	<li><b>Learner autonomy:</b>Flashcards in this application can be easily filtered according to the category (adjective, noun and verb) and the theme (food, places, animals, numbers, etc.) using theme/category icons or word icons in the "Word List." With this feature, users can set appropriate learning goals, take charge of their learning and become autonomous learners.</li>
